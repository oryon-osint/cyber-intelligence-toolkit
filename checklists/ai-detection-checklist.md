A comprehensive and detailed checklist for detecting and analyzing AI-generated or manipulated media ‚Äî including images, video, audio, and text. It is intended for OSINT investigators, journalists, digital forensic analysts, and security professionals who require structured, reliable verification procedures.

## üñºÔ∏è Image & Visual Content Verification

-  **Anatomy & Object Integrity**
    
    - Inspect hands: count fingers, check proportions, examine nail shape and placement.
        
    - Examine eyes: look for mismatched irises, unnatural reflections, symmetry that is ‚Äútoo perfect.‚Äù
        
    - Inspect teeth: check if rendered as a uniform block, misaligned gum lines, or blurry interiors.
        
    - Inspect ears and earrings: check for asymmetry, distortions, or blending into hair/skin.
        
    - Check accessories (glasses, hats, jewelry) for warped edges, melting, or blending artifacts.
        
-  **Clothing & Fabrics**
    
    - Look for stitching errors, inconsistent textures, or repeating patterns.
        
    - Validate logos and printed text on clothing (AI often renders gibberish or blurred letters).
        
    - Check folds and shadows in fabric for natural consistency.
        
-  **Background Consistency**
    
    - Inspect signage and text in the background for legibility.
        
    - Identify warped objects (lamp posts, buildings, cars).
        
    - Check perspective lines: ensure vanishing points are consistent.
        
-  **Lighting & Shadows**
    
    - Ensure all shadows align with a single light source.
        
    - Validate intensity and direction of light on different objects.
        
    - Use [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/) to validate time of day.
        
-  **Reflections**
    
    - Inspect mirrors, windows, and water surfaces.
        
    - Ensure reflected objects match reality (orientation, size, color).
        
-  **Technical Checks**
    
    - Run **reverse image search** on full image and cropped anomalies.
        
    - Perform **Error Level Analysis (ELA)** via [Forensically](https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/).
        
    - Inspect for cloning or copy-paste elements.
        
    - Review **EXIF metadata** using [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/).
        
    - Validate GPS and timestamps against claimed context.
        

## üé• Video Verification

-  **Frame-by-Frame Analysis**
    
    - Scrub video frame by frame for inconsistencies.
        
    - Check lips vs. phonemes for sync accuracy.
        
    - Look for flickering artifacts or blending errors.
        
-  **Motion & Blur**
    
    - Validate natural motion blur; AI often generates sharp unnatural edges during motion.
        
    - Look for ‚Äúhalo‚Äù effects or ghosting in moving objects.
        
-  **Context Checks**
    
    - Verify landmarks, signs, and clothing seasonality.
        
    - Cross-check weather with [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/) or [OGIMET](https://www.ogimet.com/).
        
    - Use [SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/) for shadow analysis.
        
-  **Technical Tools**
    
    - Extract thumbnails and keyframes with [InVID](https://www.invid-project.eu/tools-and-services/invid-verification-plugin/).
        
    - Run reverse video searches.
        
    - Analyze encoding for unusual compression signatures.
        
-  **AI Detection**
    
    - Run frames through [SensityAI](https://sensity.ai/) or Reality Defender.
        
    - Apply forensic CNNs like FaceForensics++.
        

## üîä Audio Verification

-  **Listening Checks**
    
    - Identify robotic cadence, flat intonation, or overly clean delivery.
        
    - Check for missing human sounds (breathing, mouth clicks, filler words).
        
    - Detect looping or repetitive background noise.
        
-  **Spectrogram Analysis**
    
    - Generate spectrograms in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [Praat](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/).
        
    - Look for:
        
        - Clean unnatural high frequencies.
            
        - Banding artifacts.
            
        - Missing natural harmonics.
            
-  **Environmental Verification**
    
    - Validate background sounds (birds, traffic, wind) against claimed setting.
        
    - Compare ambient audio with expected acoustics (e.g., indoor echo vs. outdoor open field).

    - Identify repetitive scaffolding (e.g., ‚ÄúIn conclusion, ‚Ä¶‚Äù).
        
    - Look for vague or generic phrasing without specifics.
        
    - Check for fabricated citations, URLs, or ISBNs.
        
-  **Factual Validation**
    
    - Spot-check quotes and references against primary sources.
        
    - Cross-verify dates, events, and names in OSINT databases.
