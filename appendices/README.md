# 📂 Appendices

## 🎯 Overview

The **Appendices** directory contains supporting resources that complement the manuals, playbooks, and checklists in this repository. These files provide additional depth, reference material, and technical aids that enhance investigative workflows.

This section is designed to serve as a **resource hub** for:

* Supplementary tools and utilities
* Automation scripts and command snippets
* Technical references and data tables
* Templates for case logs and documentation

Appendices are not standalone manuals but instead provide **quick-access resources** that strengthen the core content of the repository. They are especially valuable when analysts need ready-to-use materials during field operations or forensic analysis.

## 📂 Example Contents

* **Tools Matrix** – curated list of open-source utilities with usage notes.
* **Automation Snippets** – ready-to-run command-line scripts and code fragments.
* **Case Log Templates** – standardized documentation formats for investigations.
* **Reference Data** – mappings, standards, or cross-check tables.

## 🛠️ Usage

* Use appendices alongside the **Manuals** for detailed context.
* Apply them with the **Playbooks** to streamline workflows.
* Refer to them when using the **Checklists** to ensure technical accuracy.
