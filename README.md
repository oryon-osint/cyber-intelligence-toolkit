# Cyber Intelligence Toolkit

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The **Cyber Intelligence Toolkit** is a curated collection of manuals, playbooks, checklists, and appendices built to support a wide spectrum of investigative and analytical tasks. It equips investigators, analysts, and practitioners with structured, reliable, and actionable references for digital investigations â€” from rapid verification and OSINT workflows to deep forensic analysis.

This repository emphasizes:

* **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** Methods for discovering, verifying, and analyzing information from open sources.
* **Digital Forensics:** Workflows and tools for verifying authenticity of media and digital traces.
* **AI & Synthetic Media Detection:** Practical approaches to identify AI-generated content across text, images, audio, and video.
* **Operational Security (OPSEC):** Guidelines and best practices for protecting investigators during sensitive operations.
* **Investigation Frameworks:** Standardized methodologies to ensure consistency and reproducibility.

The toolkit combines theory with hands-on procedures, making it suitable for quick field use, structured analysis, and long-term investigative projects.
