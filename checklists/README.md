# ✅ Checklists

This directory contains **operational checklists** for investigators, OSINT analysts, and forensic practitioners. Checklists are designed as **concise, step-by-step guides** that can be applied quickly in the field or during investigations.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Provide **short, actionable references** without lengthy explanations.
* Support **rapid triage, verification, and validation** tasks.
* Ensure **consistency and completeness** in investigative workflows.

## 📂 Example Topics

* **OSINT Checklist** – structured process for open-source intelligence collection.
* **Forensic Lab Setup** – minimal requirements and configuration validation.
* **AI Detection Checklist** – quick steps for identifying AI-generated images, audio, and text.
* **Incident Verification** – ensuring claims match digital evidence.

## 🛠️ Usage

Checklists are meant to complement:

* The **Manuals** (in `/manuals`) for in-depth context.
* The **Playbooks** (in `/playbooks`) for workflow-oriented procedures.
* The **Appendices** (in `/appendices`) for technical details and automation.

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

If you add or modify a checklist:

1. Use **clear, concise bullet points**.
2. Keep language **action-oriented** (e.g., *Verify X*, *Check Y*).
3. Avoid unnecessary narrative — checklists should be usable under time pressure.
4. Submit as a Markdown (`.md`) file.
